openssl req
This command deals with generating and managing certificate signing requests (CSRs). CSRs are used to request digital certificates from a certificate authority (CA).

Key Options:

openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout mykey.key -out mycsr.pem
Generates a private key and a CSR file simultaneously.
-x509 option: If added, this can generate a self-signed certificate instead of a CSR.
Use Case:
Use this when you want to request an SSL/TLS certificate or create self-signed certificates for testing.

example:
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout posapp-key.pem -out posapp-req.pem -subj "/CN=POS App/O=World Vision Australia"
